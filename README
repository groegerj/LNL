LNL stands for "LNL not Linux". It consists of several shell scripts
to establish a chroot Debian-Linux environment on an Android system.

PURPOSE
=====================================================================

Run Debian-Linux in a chroot environment on an Android device.
The main idea has been around for some time, see e.g.

http://www.saurik.com/id/10
https://wiki.debian.org/ChrootOnAndroid

for an incomplete list.
LNL is my own implementation with some advantages over the existing
solutions.

More explanation to come soon (explain directory blabla,
home dir solution, resolv.conf etc.)

PREREQUISITES
=====================================================================

1) A rooted Android with su binary. This has been mainly tested on
   Cyanogenmod 13 but should work on other ROMs as well.
2) A busybox binary in /system/xbin.
3) An Android version that allows setting selinux to moderate
   (Cyanogenmod works).
4) On the Debian side, inotify-tools and dialog.
5) For best user experience, jackpal's Terminal app
   and Hacker's keyboard, both available through F-Droid.

Prerequisites to be explained in more detail...

USAGE

Documentation to be written...
Script to create a small Debian system with some settings missing...
