LNL stands for "LNL not Linux". It consists of several shell scripts
to establish a chroot Debian-Linux environment on an Android system.

PURPOSE
=====================================================================

Run Debian-Linux in a chroot environment on an Android device.
The main idea has been around for some time, see e.g.

http://www.saurik.com/id/10
https://wiki.debian.org/ChrootOnAndroid

for an incomplete list.
LNL is my own implementation with some advantages over the existing
solutions.

More explanation to come soon (explain directory blabla,
home dir solution, resolv.conf etc.)

PREREQUISITES
=====================================================================

1) A rooted Android with su binary. This has been mainly tested on
   Cyanogenmod 13 but should work on other ROMs as well.
2) A busybox binary in /system/xbin.
3) An Android version that allows setting selinux to moderate
   (Cyanogenmod works).
4) On the Debian side, inotify-tools and dialog.
5) For best user experience, jackpal's Terminal app
   and Hacker's keyboard, both available through F-Droid.

Prerequisites to be explained in more detail...

USAGE
=====================================================================

Scripts work fine provided one has a suitably configured Debian system
installed in /data/debian...

Documentation to be written...

lnl-debootstrap:
create a small Debian system and compress to an archive.
To be run on a Debian system.
Status: not yet really tested, but should work ok.

Steps to do for installation:

*) copy archive file (result of lnl-debootstrap) to Android device
*) On Android, extract to /data/debian
*) chroot into that, run debootstrap --second-stage, add Android users/groups...
   TODO: describe in detail or, better, make another script
*) On Android, copy lnl and lnl-init to /system/xbin/
*) Now, invoking "lnl" on a terminal app should start the real thing :-)

X11 usage to be documented...
